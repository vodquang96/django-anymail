Anymail is supported and maintained by the people who use it—like you!
We welcome all contributions: issue reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements,
new features, ideas and suggestions, and anything else to help improve the package.

Before posting **questions** or **issues** in GitHub, please check out
[*Getting support*][support] and [*Troubleshooting*][troubleshooting]
in the Anymail docs. Also…

> …when you're reporting a problem or bug, it's *really helpful* to include:
> * which **ESP** you're using (Mailgun, SendGrid, etc.)
> * what **versions** of Anymail, Django, and Python you're running
> * any error messages and exception stack traces
> * the relevant portions of your code and settings
> * any [troubleshooting] you've tried

For more info on **pull requests** and the **development** environment,
please see [*Contributing*][contributing] in the docs. For significant
new features or breaking changes, it's always a good idea to
propose the idea in the [discussions] forum before writing
a lot of code.
