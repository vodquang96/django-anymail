.. _sendgrid-backend:

SendGrid
========

Anymail integrates with the `SendGrid`_ email service,
using their `Web API v2`_. (Their v3 API does not support sending mail,
but the v3 API calls *do* get information about mail sent through v2.)

.. _Web API v2: https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html


Settings
--------


.. rubric:: EMAIL_BACKEND

To use Anymail's SendGrid backend, set:

  .. code-block:: python

      EMAIL_BACKEND = "anymail.backends.sendgrid.SendGridBackend"

in your settings.py. (Watch your capitalization: SendGrid spells
their name with an uppercase "G", so Anymail does too.)


.. setting:: ANYMAIL_SENDGRID_API_KEY

.. rubric:: SENDGRID_API_KEY

A SendGrid API key with "Mail Send" permission.
(Manage API keys in your `SendGrid API key settings`_.)
Either an API key or both :setting:`SENDGRID_USERNAME <ANYMAIL_SENDGRID_USERNAME>`
and :setting:`SENDGRID_PASSWORD <ANYMAIL_SENDGRID_PASSWORD>` are required.

  .. code-block:: python

      ANYMAIL = {
          ...
          "SENDGRID_API_KEY": "<your API key>",
      }

Anymail will also look for ``SENDGRID_API_KEY`` at the
root of the settings file if neither ``ANYMAIL["SENDGRID_API_KEY"]``
nor ``ANYMAIL_SENDGRID_API_KEY`` is set.

.. _SendGrid API key settings: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys


.. setting:: ANYMAIL_SENDGRID_USERNAME
.. setting:: ANYMAIL_SENDGRID_PASSWORD

.. rubric:: SENDGRID_USERNAME and SENDGRID_PASSWORD

SendGrid credentials with the "Mail" permission. You should **not**
use the username/password that you use to log into SendGrid's
dashboard. Create credentials specifically for sending mail in the
`SendGrid credentials settings`_.

  .. code-block:: python

      ANYMAIL = {
          ...
          "SENDGRID_USERNAME": "<sendgrid credential with Mail permission>",
          "SENDGRID_PASSWORD": "<password for that credential>",
      }

Either username/password or :setting:`SENDGRID_API_KEY <ANYMAIL_SENDGRID_API_KEY>`
are required (but not both).

Anymail will also look for ``SENDGRID_USERNAME`` and ``SENDGRID_PASSWORD`` at the
root of the settings file if neither ``ANYMAIL["SENDGRID_USERNAME"]``
nor ``ANYMAIL_SENDGRID_USERNAME`` is set.

.. _SendGrid credentials settings: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/credentials


.. setting:: ANYMAIL_SENDGRID_GENERATE_MESSAGE_ID

.. rubric:: SENDGRID_GENERATE_MESSAGE_ID

Whether Anymail should generate a Message-ID for messages sent
through SendGrid, to facilitate event tracking.

Default ``True``. You can set to ``False`` to disable this behavior.
See :ref:`Message-ID quirks <sendgrid-message-id>` below.


.. setting:: ANYMAIL_SENDGRID_MERGE_FIELD_FORMAT

.. rubric:: SENDGRID_MERGE_FIELD_FORMAT

If you use :ref:`merge data <merge-data>`, set this to a :meth:`str.format`
formatting string that indicates how merge fields are delimited
in your SendGrid templates.
For example, if your templates use the ``-field-`` hyphen delimiters
suggested in some SendGrid docs, you would set:

  .. code-block:: python

      ANYMAIL = {
          ...
          "SENDGRID_MERGE_FIELD_FORMAT": "-{}-",
      }

The placeholder `{}` will become the merge field name. If you need to include
a literal brace character, double it up. (For example, Handlebars-style
``{{field}}`` delimiters would take the format string `"{{{{{}}}}}"`.)

The default `None` requires you include the delimiters directly in your
:attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.merge_data` keys.
You can also override this setting for individual messages.
See the notes on SendGrid :ref:`templates and merge <sendgrid-templates>`
below.


.. setting:: ANYMAIL_SENDGRID_API_URL

.. rubric:: SENDGRID_API_URL

The base url for calling the SendGrid v2 API.

The default is ``SENDGRID_API_URL = "https://api.sendgrid.com/api/"``
(It's unlikely you would need to change this.)


.. _sendgrid-esp-extra:

esp_extra support
-----------------

To use SendGrid features not directly supported by Anymail, you can
set a message's :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.esp_extra` to
a `dict` of parameters for SendGrid's `mail.send API`_. Any keys in
your :attr:`esp_extra` dict will override Anymail's normal values
for that parameter, except that `'x-smtpapi'` will be merged.

Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        message.esp_extra = {
            'x-smtpapi': {
                "asm_group": 1,  # Assign SendGrid unsubscribe group for this message
                "asm_groups_to_display": [1, 2, 3],
                "filters": {
                    "subscriptiontrack": {  # Insert SendGrid subscription management links
                        "settings": {
                            "text/html": "If you would like to unsubscribe <% click here %>.",
                            "text/plain": "If you would like to unsubscribe click here: <% %>.",
                            "enable": 1
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }


(You can also set `"esp_extra"` in Anymail's
:ref:`global send defaults <send-defaults>` to apply it to all
messages.)


.. _mail.send API: https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html#-send



Limitations and quirks
----------------------

**Duplicate attachment filenames**
  Anymail is not capable of communicating multiple attachments with
  the same filename to SendGrid. (This also applies to multiple attachments
  with *no* filename, though not to inline images.)

  If you are sending multiple attachments on a single message,
  make sure each one has a unique, non-empty filename.


.. _sendgrid-message-id:

**Message-ID**
  SendGrid does not return any sort of unique id from its send API call.
  Knowing a sent message's ID can be important for later queries about
  the message's status.

  To work around this, Anymail by default generates a new Message-ID for each
  outgoing message, provides it to SendGrid, and includes it in the
  :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.anymail_status`
  attribute after you send the message.

  In later SendGrid API calls, you can match that Message-ID
  to SendGrid's ``smtp-id`` event field. (Anymail uses an additional
  workaround to ensure smtp-id is included in all SendGrid events,
  even those that aren't documented to include it.)

  Anymail will use the domain of the message's :attr:`from_email`
  to generate the Message-ID. (If this isn't desired, you can supply
  your own Message-ID in the message's :attr:`extra_headers`.)

  To disable all of these Message-ID workarounds, set
  :setting:`ANYMAIL_SENDGRID_GENERATE_MESSAGE_ID` to False in your settings.


**Invalid Addresses**
  SendGrid will accept *and send* just about anything as
  a message's :attr:`from_email`. (And email protocols are
  actually OK with that.)

  (Tested March, 2016)


.. _sendgrid-templates:

Batch sending/merge and ESP templates
-------------------------------------

SendGrid offers both :ref:`ESP stored templates <esp-stored-templates>`
and :ref:`batch sending <batch-send>` with per-recipient merge data.

You can use a SendGrid stored template by setting a message's
:attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.template_id` to the
template's unique id. Alternatively, you can refer to merge fields
directly in an EmailMessage's subject and body---the message itself
is used as an on-the-fly template.

In either case, supply the merge data values with Anymail's
normalized :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.merge_data`
and :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.merge_global_data`
message attributes.

  .. code-block:: python

      message = EmailMessage(
          ...
          subject="",  # don't add any additional subject content to the template
          body="",  # (same thing for additional body content)
          to=["alice@example.com", "Bob <bob@example.com>"]
      )
      message.template_id = "5997fcf6-2b9f-484d-acd5-7e9a99f0dc1f"  # SendGrid id
      message.merge_data = {
          'alice@example.com': {'name': "Alice", 'order_no': "12345"},
          'bob@example.com': {'name': "Bob", 'order_no': "54321"},
      }
      message.merge_global_data = {
          'ship_date': "May 15",
      }
      message.esp_extra = {
          # Tell Anymail this SendGrid template uses "-field-" to refer to merge fields.
          # (We could also just set SENDGRID_MERGE_FIELD_FORMAT in our ANYMAIL settings.)
          'merge_field_format': "-{}-"
      }

SendGrid doesn't have a pre-defined merge field syntax, so you
must tell Anymail how substitution fields are delimited in your templates.
There are three ways you can do this:

  * Set `'merge_field_format'` in the message's
    :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.esp_extra` to a python :meth:`str.format`
    string, as shown in the example above. (This applies only to that
    particular EmailMessage.)
  * *Or* set :setting:`SENDGRID_MERGE_FIELD_FORMAT <ANYMAIL_SENDGRID_MERGE_FIELD_FORMAT>`
    in your Anymail settings. This is usually the best approach, and will apply to all messages
    sent through SendGrid. (You can still use esp_extra to override for individual messages.)
  * *Or* include the field delimiters directly in *all* your
    :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.merge_data` and
    :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.merge_global_data` keys.
    E.g.: ``{'-name-': "Alice", '-order_no-': "12345"}``.
    (This can be error-prone, and difficult to move to other ESPs.)

When you supply per-recipient :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.merge_data`,
Anymail automatically changes how it communicates the "to" list to SendGrid, so that
so that each recipient sees only their own email address. (Anymail moves the recipients
from top-level "to" and "toname" API parameters into the "x-smtpapi" section "to" list.)

SendGrid templates allow you to mix your EmailMessage's `subject` and `body`
with the template subject and body (by using `<%subject%>` and `<%body%>` in
your SendGrid template definition where you want the message-specific versions
to appear). If you don't want to supply any additional subject or body content
from your Django app, set those EmailMessage attributes to empty strings.

(Anymail will convert empty text and HTML bodies to single spaces whenever
:attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.template_id` is set, to ensure the
plaintext and HTML from your template are present in your outgoing email.
This works around a `limitation in SendGrid's template rendering`_.)

See the `SendGrid's template overview`_ and `transactional template docs`_
for more information.

.. _sendgrid-webhooks:

Status tracking webhooks
------------------------

If you are using Anymail's normalized :ref:`status tracking <event-tracking>`, enter
the url in your `SendGrid mail settings`_, under "Event Notification":

   :samp:`https://{random}:{random}@{yoursite.example.com}/anymail/sendgrid/tracking/`

     * *random:random* is an :setting:`ANYMAIL_WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION` shared secret
     * *yoursite.example.com* is your Django site

Be sure to check the boxes in the SendGrid settings for the event types you want to receive.

SendGrid will report these Anymail :attr:`~anymail.signals.AnymailTrackingEvent.event_type`\s:
queued, rejected, bounced, deferred, delivered, opened, clicked, complained, unsubscribed,
subscribed.

The event's :attr:`~anymail.signals.AnymailTrackingEvent.esp_event` field will be
a `dict` of `Sendgrid event`_ fields, for a single event. (Although SendGrid calls
webhooks with batches of events, Anymail will invoke your signal receiver separately
for each event in the batch.)
